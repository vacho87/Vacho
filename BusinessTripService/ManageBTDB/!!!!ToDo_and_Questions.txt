QUESTIONS:
1. Is SET{} method of entitiy-class's property a good way for realizing validation when new instance of entity is creating?
2. When one class's property in it's set method refers another property of the class should it refer the property
or it's private field to boost productivity (I suppose that incapsulation principles are not broken when refer private field) ?



TODO:
1. Apply method AsNoTracking() for implementation READ methods
2. Add (what table-entity is the best for it?) property "prePay"
